# Lyft Interview

## Response to the Technical Portion

- Using Python and FastAPI, we accept the `/test` route that accepts a `string_to_cut` argument

- The response object is a `return_string` that contains every third letter of the passed `string_to_cut` argument

- I have also provided a simple HTML page that mimics this functionality
